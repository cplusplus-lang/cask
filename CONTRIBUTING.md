## Before hacking on Cask

We encourage people to discuss their design before hacking on code. Typically,
you [file an issue] before submitting a pull request.

Please read [the process] of how features and bugs are managed in Cask.
**Only issues that have been explicitly marked as [accepted] will be reviewed.**
